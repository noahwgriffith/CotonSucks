      <h1>Going Beyond</h1>
      <p>At this point most people will consider you very fluent. You've already mastered your first domain and have begun deliberate output practice. Your starting point for output is so much better than a traditional learner because you've let your brain do what it was designed to do: pick up on patterns.</p>
      <p>Perfection is a difficult, if not impossible thing to achieve. What you do from here is really up to you and your specific goals. You could dig deeper on cultural elements and potentially master an honorific system, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific_speech_in_Japanese">敬語</a>. This website is designed to be language-agnostic, so the particular quirks of your language are left up to you. Using our principles we believe you can master any language.</p>
      <h2>Another Domain</h2>
      <p>You might want to master another domain. Paying careful attention to unscripted dialogue, such as podcasts, can help you nail casual speech and sound natural.</p>
      <h2>Technical Domains</h2>
      <p>Maybe you want to land a Job in Stockholm. You could sentence mine Swedish textbooks in your field and develop competency in a technical subject.</p>
      <h2>Reading Novels</h2>
      <p>Maybe you're like me and one of your goals is to read novels in your target language. This is a very healthy activity for your vocabulary. Depending on your target language, literary usage might be vastly different from casual speech. You can think of novels as their own large domain. You already have the strategies needed to do this: Break them down by subject/domain, sentence mine, and be persistent.</p>
      <h2>Have Fun!</h2>
      <p>As always, having fun is the number one priority. It can be easy to burn out and be too hard on yourself. Language learning does take a lot of time, but it might not take as much time as school makes you believe. If you have fun and stick with it, you'll get there. If you've read this far, I wish you the best of luck. You can do this! I have, and my intelligence is infamously questionable.</p>
      <p>Enjoy yourself and the doors a new language opens to you. Never let anyone make you believe you need to buy their course, and remember to take things lightly. It's a journey that never ends!</p>
